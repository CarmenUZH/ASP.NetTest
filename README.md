Here i am following a tutorial about the .net language

In the bathroom, on my back
There's a picture on the wall of Kanye West
He's staring at me, he's staring at me
im freaking out, im freaking out

Im on the lawn, it's almost three
I look around, I look at her, she looks at me
She's suspicious, she's suspicious
Im freaking out, im freaking out

I'm feeling fine
I found a flowe, it's in my shoe and it is mine
Things are fine now, yeah it's alright
And all these god damn people in the world
They're all just getting by
I'm in the back room, she's with a guy
He's selling happiness and hopefulness
One bag at a time
I'm standing up, I'm sitting down
I'm freaking out, I'm freaking out
